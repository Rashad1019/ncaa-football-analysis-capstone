# 🏈 NCAA Football Analysis (2013–2023) — Capstone Case Study

This is a **portfolio-ready data analytics capstone project** analyzing NCAA FBS football data from 2013 to 2023. The project follows the full **Google Data Analytics Case Study framework** — structured across six phases: Ask, Prepare, Process, Analyze, Share, and Act.

The goal is to identify what truly makes a winning college football team by exploring trends in offensive and defensive efficiency, turnover margins, third-down conversion rates, and overall team balance.

## 📊 Summary of Original Study

Before structuring this project as a capstone, I conducted an exploratory analysis focused on identifying what makes a winning NCAA football team.

📎 **[View the Original Study (GitHub Pages)](https://rashad1019.github.io/ncaa-football-analysis/)**

Key findings from the original study include:

- **Balanced teams** (strong in both offense and defense) had the highest win rates (84.7%)
- **Third-down conversion**, **red-zone efficiency**, and **turnover margins** were the strongest predictors of success
- **Special teams** performance had minimal impact on win percentage
- The **SEC** was the most dominant conference during the period analyzed

This exploratory work laid the foundation for the structured capstone version you see here.

## 📌 Project Objectives

- Apply the six-phase Google framework to a real-world dataset
- Perform data cleaning and transformation using Google Sheets
- Model key predictors of team success across 130+ FBS programs
- Share results with executive summary, visualizations, and slides
- Deliver a polished, presentation-ready analytics portfolio project

## 🔍 Highlights

- **145+ team metrics analyzed** across 11 seasons (2013–2023)
- **Efficiency metrics** predict 72% of win % variance
- **Balanced teams** win 84.7% of the time
- **Special teams** have minimal impact on success

## 💡 Reflection

This project deepened my skills in structuring real-world analysis, communicating data-backed recommendations, and building deliverables tailored to technical and non-technical audiences alike.

Next steps: incorporate player-level performance data and build predictive models with game-level granularity.
